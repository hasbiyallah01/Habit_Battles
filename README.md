Habit Battles

Habit Battles is a gamified habit tracker that transforms personal growth into friendly competition. Two friends compete by completing daily habits, with each completed task counting as a “strike” against a shared monster. Missing a day allows the monster to heal or retaliate, introducing a fun and challenging sense of accountability.

Players earn coins and badges that can be used to unlock avatars, themes, and new monsters, making habit-building engaging, consistent, and rewarding.
